**Stage1: Webpage Preparation**
1.Download the GitHub package, create a Flask project in the Python interpreter. After extracting the files, place the corresponding scripts, HTML files, and images into their respective folders.
2.Run `app.py`, and then click on the port to access the webpage.
**Stage2: Webpage Usage**
1.Website simulation options. Simulating coverage depth using sequencing data documents corresponds to Option "Upload Sequencing File" in "Select Simulation Type." Simulating coverage depth based solely on designed PCR amplification efficiency without sequencing data corresponds to Option "Upload PCR Efficiency File". Conducting a pure simulation without sequencing data or PCR amplification efficiency design corresponds to Option "Pure Simulation". The first two options each provide an example document. Users can choose to download the example document and upload it for a demonstration simulation, or directly upload their own experimental data file for simulation. Please note that we have set default values, which you can replace with your own values as needed for the simulation.
2.Option "Upload Sequencing File". Under this option, three sections are provided: Data Analysis and Channel Probability Distribution Simulation, Sample Information Extraction Completeness, Minimum Sequencing Coverage Depth for Recovering All Information. Section 1 
3.Option "Upload PCR Efficiency File". 
4.Option "Pure Simulation".
